    # NB: Task's globbing is finicky and tracking all possible go files is
    # prone to error. Instead, rely on go build's caching. Cache status must be
    # reflected through `status` in order to not re-fire dependent tasks (e.g.
    # gotohelm invocations)
    # `go build -n` reports all commands to build without running them. When a
    # rebuild is required, the final lines will contain: 'mv $WORK/<somepath> < -o flag >'.
    # Negating the output of grep effectively indicates if go thinks a rebuild
    # is required. Command must be encased in "s as the negation operator (!)
    # is otherwise consumed during YAML parsing.
